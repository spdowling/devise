Use case 1:

Login page
Choose target environment
	-- choosing this item implies that we have a configured list of environments somewhere
	-- this again implies that we can introduce a new set of environments in the configuration
	-- and have it load it up again...
	-- we can either store environments in the static configuration files
	-- or allow users to edit as they wish
Enter username and password
Validate before submit
Submit
Login success - go to dashboard
Login failure - flash message error

Use case 2:

From dashboard go to pattern editor
Should show all available patterns
Can subclass a pattern to create a new one
Can edit an existing pattern
Subclass Product
Can't edit inherited items
Add new attributes
Cancel (discard changes)
Subclass product again name it ProductTwo
Save
List should include new item sorted into list

Use case 3:

Go to instance editor
Should see all instances
Create new instance
Select ProductTwo as Pattern to use
Fill in some values
Save
- new instance created by me so not available to anybody else to edit until I save
Edit again
This will fork/branch and generate a workspace version assigned to me
Edit and save
Now in merge mode or ready to merge

Use case 4:

Go to instance management
Shows instances and which ones have changes outstanding
Merge changes we made to instance
Saving this forces actual update of real instance
Others can now see the changes when viewing their version? Possibly only after saving their changes. Unless we put in some ability to auto update....
Another user saves their version
When opening the item they can switch between the general version and their own workspace version
They can get the latest values by rebasing their branch against original
That means instance mgmt should be an tab of some kind? Could well be.
